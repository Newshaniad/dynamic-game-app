### Game Description
You will be matched with another player and play a 2-period dynamic game. 
In each period, you simultaneously choose an action. After both players submit,
the outcome and payoffs will be shown before moving to the next round.

**Payoff Matrix (Player 1, Player 2):**

|         | X       | Y       | Z       |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **A**   | (4, 3)  | (0, 0)  | (1, 4)  |
| **B**   | (0, 0)  | (2, 1)  | (0, 0)  |
